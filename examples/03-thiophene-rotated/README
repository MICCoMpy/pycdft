This folder contains input files for calculating the coupling between thiophene-thiophene+ dimer
using PyCDFT.
    delta*.in
    delta*.cif

where delta indicates the relative rotated angle of two thiophene molecules at 5 Angstrom distance 

This example is configured for Midway 2 at UChicago RCC but can be easily adapted to other machines.
To run this example on Midway 2:

1) Run Qbox with external potentials (vext) implemented
 >> qsub thio_delta_gs

2) Set up CDFT calculation
 >> bash ./setup_thio_delta

3) Run CDFT calculation
 >> qsub thio_delta_pycdft
