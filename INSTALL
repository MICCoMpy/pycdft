Installation
------------

In order to install and use **pyCDFT**

1. Compile DFT driver

**pyCDFT** is currently compatible with Qbox (used in `client-server mode <http://qboxcode.org/doc/html/usage/client-server.html>`_). Other DFT codes may be added in the future as needed.

 - `Install Qbox <http://qboxcode.org/doc/html/usage/installation.html>`_
 - `Install Qbox on Mira <https://www.alcf.anl.gov/user-guides/qbox>`_

PyCDFT has been tested with Python 3.6+, Qbox 1.67.4+. 
A version of Qbox that is capable of handling external potentials via the variable **vext** is required.
Currently PyCDFT is compatible with **cube** and **Function3d** formats.


2. Install PyCDFT

The basic command is:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python setup.py install 

You may need to modify which directory to install in with "--prefix=/desired/installation/path/pycdft/"

E.g., On UChicago RCC Midway 2

.. code-block:: bash

   export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/desired/installation/path/pycdft/:/desired/installation/path/pycdft/lib/python3.7/site-packages"
   python setup.py install --prefix="/desired/installation/path"

Be sure to load python v 3.6+, e.g., 

.. code-block:: bash

   $ module load python
   $ module list
