# ### Tutorial: coupling constant for He$_2^+$

# Here we will do a proper run of PyCDFT and include the calculation of the electron coupling.
# Instead of randomly guessing an initial constraint potential $V$, we shall use the `brentq` or `brenth` optimizers to perform a search. For these particular optimizers, we need to specify a range of $V$ where the function space is sampled for both positive and negative values; a range of (-2,2) is typically sufficient.
# 
# As before, we initialize the system in the PyCDFT module.
