The following *.spavr files are spherically averaged charge density for an isolated atom.
They are generated using the QE + westpp code (http://www.west-code.org/doc/INPUT_WESTPP.html).
Based on PBE wavefunctions of ONCV pseudopotentials.
Post-processing through WEST interface for charge density. 

A note from He (Sept 2018):
Note that there was a bug in westpp code that incorrectly treats the G=0 component of rho, 
and will lead to negative tails of radial density. So if somehow you cannot reproduce my 
sesults with exactly the same input file, maybe you can ask Marco if he has already merged 
the bug fix into the trunk of the westpp repo.
